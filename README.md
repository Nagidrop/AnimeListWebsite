# AnimeListWebsite Project

This project aims to develop a website using Java. It will have similar functionalities compared to MyAnimeList.com (a.k.a MAL - which is also used as a template/reference to design) but with only limited core functions, such as view, search and add animes to list. 

> Basic functions that enable users to log in, register and view their profiles, and enable admin to manage the users are as well included. 

> This is used as an assignment project in university.


*Written in Java, with MVC 2 architecture, Bootstrap and Struts 2 Framework on NetBeans IDE 8.2.*
